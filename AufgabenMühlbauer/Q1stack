# Instructions

These practice questions cover the Python fundamentals from Notebook 1: variables, data types, strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and control flow (conditionals and loops).

**Important:** Work through these questions yourself without using AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). The goal is to practice and strengthen your Python skills through hands-on problem-solving.
