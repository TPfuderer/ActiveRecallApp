# Instructions

These practice questions cover the topics from Notebook 3: functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), loops, conditionals, debugging, and regular expressions. Questions progressively increase in difficulty and integrate concepts from Notebooks 1 and 2 (data types, collections, NumPy, Pandas).

**Datasets:** Several CSV files in the `data/questions/` directory are used throughout:

- `students.csv` - Student information (name, age, gpa, major, grade, credits)
- `sales.csv` - Sales transactions (date, product, category, region, price, quantity, revenue)
- `weather.csv` - Weather data (date, city, temperature, precipitation)
- `employees.csv` - Employee records (name, department, salary, years_experience, performance_score)

**Important:** Work through these questions yourself without using AI tools. The goal is to practice and strengthen your Python skills through hands-on problem-solving.

- Raises `InsufficientFundsError` with message "Insufficient funds: need ${amount} but only have ${balance}" if amount > balance
- Returns the new balance (balance - amount) if withdrawal is successful

**Step 3:** Test with `withdraw(100, 50)` and `withdraw(100, 150)` using try-except.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 427
Write a function `validate_age(age)` that uses `assert` to check:
- `age >= 0` (message: "Age cannot be negative")
- `age <= 120` (message: "Age cannot exceed 120")

Test with ages: 25, -5, 150.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 428
Write code that tries to open the file `"nonexistent_file.csv"`. Catch `FileNotFoundError` and print: "Error: The file 'nonexistent_file.csv' was not found."

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 429
Write a function `safe_int_convert(value)` that:
- Tries to convert value to int and return it
- If conversion fails (ValueError), returns `None`

Test with: `"42"`, `"abc"`, `3.14`, `[1, 2, 3]`

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 430
Write code that:
1. Creates a list `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`
2. Tries to access `fruits[10]`
3. Catches `IndexError` and prints "Index out of range. List has only X items." (where X is the actual length)

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 431
**Method 1:** Use try-except to handle KeyError when accessing `person["email"]` from `person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`. Print "Email not found" if the key doesn't exist.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

**Method 2:** Use `.get()` method to safely retrieve the email with default value "No email provided".

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 432
Use a context manager (with statement) to open `"data/questions/students.csv"`, read the first line, and print it. The file will automatically close even if an error occurs.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 433
Write a function `parse_config(config_dict)` that:
1. Tries to extract required keys: 'host', 'port', and 'database' from a dictionary
2. Converts 'port' to an integer
3. Returns a formatted string: "Connecting to {database} at {host}:{port}"
4. Handles `KeyError` if a required key is missing (print "Missing required key: {key_name}")
5. Handles `ValueError` if port cannot be converted to int (print "Port must be a valid number")

Test with valid and invalid configurations.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 434
Write code that tries to add `"Hello"` and `5`. Catch the `TypeError` and print: "Cannot add string and integer. Attempted to add 'Hello' + 5"

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 435
Write a function `validate_input(data)` that:
- Raises `TypeError` with message "Input must be a string" if data is not a string
- Raises `ValueError` with message "Input cannot be empty" if string is empty
- Uses `assert` to check `len(data) >= 5` with message "Input must be at least 5 characters"
- Returns `True` if all checks pass

Test with: `"Hello"`, `""`, `123`, `"Hi"`

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 436
**Step 1:** Create a decorator `error_handler` that wraps a function in try-except and prints "Error occurred: {exception message}" if an exception occurs.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

**Step 2:** Apply the decorator to a function that divides two numbers. Test with valid and invalid inputs.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 437
**Step 1:** Import the logging module and configure it with `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)`.

**Step 2:** Write code that tries to divide 10 by 0, catches the exception, and logs it using `logging.error("Division error: " + str(e))`.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 438
Write a function `load_and_process(filename)` that:
1. Tries to open and read a file
2. If `FileNotFoundError` occurs, logs "File not found: {filename}" using print
3. Re-raises the exception using `raise` (without arguments to preserve traceback)

Test with a non-existent file.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 439
Write a function `safe_load_students(filepath)` that tries to load `data/questions/students.csv` and handles:
- `FileNotFoundError`: print "Error: File not found at {filepath}"
- `pd.errors.EmptyDataError`: print "Error: The CSV file is empty"
- `KeyError` (missing expected column): print "Error: Required column 'gpa' not found"

Return the DataFrame if successful, `None` if any error occurs.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Your code here

```

### Question 440
Write a comprehensive function `process_student_data(filepath)` that:

**Step 1:** Tries to load the CSV file (handle `FileNotFoundError`)

**Step 2:** Checks if the DataFrame is empty (handle empty data)

**Step 3:** Verifies required columns exist: 'name', 'age', 'gpa' (handle `KeyError`)

**Step 4:** Tries to calculate average GPA (handle potential `ValueError` if gpa contains non-numeric values)

**Step 5:** Returns a dictionary: `{"success": True, "avg_gpa": X, "num_students": Y}` or `{"success": False, "error": "error message"}`

Test with `"data/questions/students.csv"` and a non-existent file.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Your code here

```
