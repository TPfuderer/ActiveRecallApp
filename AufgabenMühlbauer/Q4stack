# Instructions

This document contains coding questions covering topics from Notebook 4 of the Python Data Analysis course. Questions are primarily based on the material taught in `nb4_plotting.qmd`, with a few questions requiring students to explore documentation independently.

**Datasets:** Several CSV files in the `data/questions/` directory are used throughout. Each question specifies which dataset to use:

- `students.csv` - Student information (name, age, gpa, major, grade, credits)
- `sales.csv` - Sales transactions (date, product, category, region, price, quantity, revenue)
- `weather.csv` - Weather data (date, city, temperature, precipitation)
- `employees.csv` - Employee records (name, department, salary, years_experience, performance_score)

```{python}
# Your code here

```

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 403

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 406

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 407

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 410

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 411
Using `data/questions/students.csv`, create a pie chart showing the proportion of students in each major. Display percentages using the `autopct` parameter.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 412
Create two line plots on the same figure using `data/questions/employees.csv`: one showing average salary by years_experience and another showing average performance_score by years_experience. Scale the performance score by 10000 so both lines are visible on the same scale. Use different colors, label the y-axis "Value", and add a legend.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 413
Using `data/questions/sales.csv`, create a grouped bar chart comparing total quantity sold by region for two different product categories. Use the technique from nb4 (adjusting x positions with numpy).

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 414
Create a scatter plot using `data/questions/employees.csv` with salary vs years_experience. Overlay a line plot connecting the average salary for each year of experience on top of the scatter points.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 415
Using `data/questions/students.csv`, create a bar chart showing average GPA by grade level and save the plot to a file called "gpa_by_grade.png" using `plt.savefig()`.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 416
Create a histogram of the salary column from `data/questions/employees.csv` with 15 bins. Add an edge color to the bars using `edgecolor='black'` to make the bins more distinguishable.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 417
Apply the 'ggplot' style using `plt.style.use('ggplot')` and create a line plot of temperature over time from `data/questions/weather.csv`. Reset to default style afterwards.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 418
Print all available plot styles using `plt.style.available` and then create any simple plot using a style of your choice (other than 'ggplot' or 'default').

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 419
Using `data/questions/employees.csv`, create a scatter plot of salary vs years_experience. Add custom colors (e.g., `color='purple'`) and markers (e.g., `marker='x'`).

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 420
(Note: Requires knowledge from nb5) Using `data/questions/employees.csv`, create a scatter plot of salary vs years_experience and overlay a linear regression line. Use `scipy.stats.linregress()` to calculate the regression parameters.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

## Seaborn (10 Questions)

Note: The notebook primarily covers `sns.displot()` with KDE. These questions test that knowledge plus encourage independent exploration of the seaborn documentation.

### Question 421
Import seaborn as sns and load `data/questions/students.csv`. Create a distribution plot using `sns.displot()` showing the distribution of GPA with 15 bins.

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 422

```{python}
# Your code here

```

### Question 423
Using `data/questions/students.csv`, create a distribution plot of credits using `sns.displot()`. Set `stat='probability'` to show proportions instead of counts.
